# ✅ Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Files Ready
- [x] `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- [x] `requirements.txt` - All dependencies listed
- [x] `maintenance_classifier_model.pkl` - Trained model
- [x] `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` - TF-IDF vectorizer
- [x] `maintenance_logs_dataset.csv` - Dataset
- [x] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- [x] `.gitignore` - Git ignore file
- [x] `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- [x] `test_deployment.py` - Test script

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] All imports working correctly
- [x] Model files can be loaded
- [x] Dataset loads successfully
- [x] NLTK data available
- [x] No hardcoded paths
- [x] Error handling in place
- [x] Caching implemented for performance

### ✅ Dependencies
- [x] streamlit==1.28.1
- [x] scikit-learn==1.3.0
- [x] pandas==2.0.3
- [x] numpy==1.24.3
- [x] seaborn==0.12.2
- [x] joblib==1.3.2
- [x] nltk==3.8.1
- [x] plotly==5.17.0

## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository
- [ ] Create GitHub repository (if not exists)
- [ ] Push all files to repository
- [ ] Ensure all files are committed

### 2. Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
- [ ] Sign in with GitHub account
- [ ] Click "New app"
- [ ] Select your repository
- [ ] Set main file path to: `app.py`
- [ ] Click "Deploy!"

### 3. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Check build logs for any errors
- [ ] Test the deployed application
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Share the public URL

## Expected URL Format
```
https://your-app-name-your-username.streamlit.app
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
1. Check build logs in Streamlit Cloud
2. Verify all files are in the repository
3. Check `requirements.txt` for version conflicts
4. Ensure no large files (>100MB) are included

### If App Doesn't Load
1. Check if model files are accessible
2. Verify NLTK data downloads correctly
3. Check for any import errors in logs

### Performance Issues
1. Model loading is cached with `@st.cache_resource`
2. NLTK data is cached after first download
3. Large files are optimized for cloud deployment

## Success Indicators
- ✅ App loads without errors
- ✅ Model predictions work correctly
- ✅ All UI features function properly
- ✅ File upload works for batch processing
- ✅ Charts and visualizations display correctly
